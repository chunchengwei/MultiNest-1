I can thorugh my analysis away, or the results about the scale radius for the following reason:
(1) The prior range allow for the scale radius is 10 to 300 kpc. I am only considering the rotation curve for 
    galactocentric distances up to 25 kpc. Therefore, any result beyond this radii is an extrapolation and is
    not consistent.
    
Ariana ask me, what are my results for the scale radius when using a NFW ( this is a generalized NFW, with α=1).
Since this α-value is bigger than the best fit obtain for a generalized, the new analyses pointed towards 
bigger scale radius (of the order of 80 kpc). Again, this could not be taken as a consistent result since is 
just an extrapolation. But it may be interesting since it is contrary at what we where thinking, pussing to lower
scales radius values which are expected from simulations.


PROSPECTS:
(1) Incorporate observed rotation velocities in the outer galaxy.
