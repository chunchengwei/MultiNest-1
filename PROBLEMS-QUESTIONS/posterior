In the posterior.py file I have computed the marginal posterior distribution within two different methods 
which lead to:
(1) Different posterior distribution morphology
(2) Same area within the p.d.f. This area should be equal 1. Instead is equal to the size of the bin, 
    therefore there is a dependence with the size of the bin which I do not understand.

The two methods are described below:
(1) The posterior distribution is just given by the number of points inside each bin divided by
the total number of points (the total number of points in the case under study is 7600)
(2) Given a bin with values of parameters between param_i and param_(i+1), the value of the 
    posterior is the sum of sample-posterior (first column) of those parameters that lie inside
    the bin.
This second method give the same results as the matlab program downloaded from Internet (gives the same morphology)

The dependence of the (2) method with the Bin's size is due to the fact that the sum
of the sample posterior probability over all the points in the sample (7600) equals 1. (I have checked this statement via Canopy).
The dependence of (1) is due to the fact that I am summing over all points which equals the total number and I am divided by the 
total number.

I have try a third method to compute the posterior which is multiply the posterior value obtain with method (2) by the 
number of points. This is equal to include the following code:
>>
    for i in range(len(postBIN)):
        postBIN[i]=postBIN[i]*pointsBIN[i]
>>
With this new method I obtain a value for the area also dependent on the size bin and which is bigger than 1.
